# jpshokar-projects

This organization is a project dump that acts as a storage medium for less professional projects.

Most of these projects are either: 
  - Things I made which have no practical usage.
  - Code snippets. (Rare, as I typically host them either on Pastebin, or Hastebin)
  - Things I made for school.


This project dump is more active than my repository as I typically make dummy projects.
